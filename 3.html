        <p>
          A stove can bring warmth to anyone. In this era, fewer young people will enter the kitchen, and fewer and fewer people can see the stove. Almost no one feels the warmth that the stove brings to a family. Traditional Minnan architecture, with its unique construction and flexible design, combines family space with stoves. During festivals or important moments, family members offer sacrifices in front of the stoves, and the halo of the Kitchen God shines on every corner of the room like the fire of the stove, protecting every family member.

          I drew inspiration from architecture in the MinNan region and traditional Chinese stoves to create this work, embellishing red bricks with ceramic shards and surrounding a real flame. The audience can feel the temperature of the flames with their hands, and from the patterns of these pottery pieces, they can associate them with the past stove culture, once again feeling the warmth of the stove from every family that spans time and space.
